## Development
Development mainly happens inside `script.js` and `style.css`.

1. Edit `script.js` to modify the game logic.
2. Edit `style.css` to adjust visual styles.
3. For testing changes, run a local HTTP server (for example with `python3 -m http.server`) and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. This avoids issues with local file permissions.
4. Refresh the browser to see your changes.

Have fun!
